# TeddyCloud

## Features
TeddyCloud is an alternative server for your Toniebox, allowing you to host the cloud services locally.
This gives you the control about which data is sent to the original manufacturer's cloud and allows you
to host your own figurine audio files on e.g. your NAS or any other server.

Currently implemented are:
* Provide audio content over the air
* Cache original tonie audio content
* Simulate live content (.live)
* Passthrough original tonie audio content
* Convert any audio file to a tonie audio file (web)
* On-the-fly convert audio streams via ffmpeg for webradio and streams
* Basic Web fronted
* Filter custom tags to prevent deletion (.nocloud)
* Configure maximum volume for speaker and headphones
* Configure LED
* Configure slapping
* Customize original box sounds (ex. jingle) over the air
* Extract/Inject certitifcates on a esp32 firmware dump
* Decode RTNL logs
* MQTT client
* Home Assistant integration (MQTT)
* [Web frontend](https://github.com/toniebox-reverse-engineering/teddycloud_web) (full stack developers welcome)
